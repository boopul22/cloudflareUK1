YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES
Last Updated: January 26, 2026
If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you have specific rights regarding your personal data. This page allows you to exercise your Right to Opt-Out of the sale/sharing of your data and your Right to Limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
1. NOTICE OF DATA PRACTICES
Auto File Claim is a marketing and technology platform. To provide our services, we "sell" or "share" your information (including identifiers and accident details) with our Marketing Partners (law firms and intake specialists). Because the information you provide often includes details about your physical injuries, it is classified as Sensitive Personal Information.
PLEASE NOTE: Our service is built on the transfer of this data. If you opt-out or limit the use of this data, we cannot match you with a law firm or process your inquiry.

2. EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS
Please use the form below to submit your request. We will process your request within the timeframe required by your state’s law (typically 15–45 days).
Step 1: Your Information
Full Name: 
Email Address: 
Phone Number:  (Essential for scrubbing you from our dialer)
State of Residence: [ Dropdown: CA, TX, CO, WA, VA, CT, UT, Other ]
Step 2: Select Your Request
[ ] Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information: Stop the transfer of my data to third parties for marketing or administrative fees.
[ ] Limit the Use and Disclosure of My Sensitive Personal Information: I request that you restrict the use of my health/injury data to only what is strictly necessary to provide the service. (Note: This will prevent us from sharing your injury details with law firms).
[ ] Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising: Do not use my data for cross-context behavioral advertising.
[ ] Request to Delete: Permanently remove my record from your database.
[ SUBMIT PRIVACY REQUEST ]

3. AUTOMATED OPT-OUT (GPC)
We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals. If your browser or device sends a GPC signal, we will automatically opt you out of the "sale" and "sharing" of your personal information for that specific session without you needing to fill out the form above.
4. OTHER CONTACT METHODS
If you have difficulty using the form, you may also submit your request via:
Email: privacy@autofileclaim.com
5. AUTHORIZED AGENTS
If you are submitting this request on behalf of another person, you must provide written proof of your authority (such as a power of attorney) to privacy@autofileclaim.com before we can process the request.



Internal Action Plan (For your Team)
Suppression: When this form is submitted, the Email and Phone should be sent to a "Global Suppression List" that prevents them from being exported to law firms or uploaded to your dialer.
Confirmation: Send a follow-up email to the user: "We have received your request to opt-out. Your information has been added to our suppression list, and we will no longer share your data with marketing partners."

The CPRA (California) requires you to notify third parties to whom you have sold or shared personal information at the time of the request.
Action: You don't necessarily have to go back exactly 90 days for every lead, but you must have a system in place to tell your Marketing Partners: "User [Phone Number] has opted out. You must stop selling/sharing this data and stop calling them." This protects you from "downstream" liability.



The "Ad Disclosure" (Site-Wide Footer)
ADVERTISEMENT: This website is a paid advertisement for a joint marketing program. Auto File Claim is not a law firm, a lawyer referral service, or an insurance provider. We do not provide legal advice, medical advice, or insurance adjusting services. This advertisement is not a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Every case is different; the outcome depends on the unique laws, facts, and circumstances of each case. Hiring an attorney is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertising. You may request free information about an attorney’s background and experience. Individuals appearing on this website may be paid actors or spokespersons and not actual lawyers or clients. Any depictions of accidents or consultations are dramatizations. Use of this site, our forms, or our phone lines does not create an attorney-client relationship.

FOR NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS: Auto File Claim is a legal advertising service. We do not offer legal services or representation. Legal services are available only through independent attorneys licensed in North Carolina. Contacting us does not create an attorney-client relationship.






California: Requires the disclosure of the specific attorney "Sponsors" if you are running a joint ad program
Sponsors Link: If you are being paid by specific lawyers, it is safest to have a link that says "View our Sponsors" listing their names.
The "Sponsors" Page Content
California and several other states require that you don't just link to a "Sponsors" page, but that the page actually contains specific information. If you are a "Joint Advertising Program," the page must list:
The Full Name of the participating attorneys or law firms.
The Office Address of at least one participating attorney.
The State(s) of Licensure for each attorney.
Add this line to that page: "Auto File Claim does not determine which attorney will handle a specific case. You have the right to choose any attorney, including those not affiliated with this program."
Database & Record Keeping (The "Audit Trail")
If you are ever sued or audited by an Attorney General, you need to prove the user actually checked the boxes.
[ ] Timestamping: Record the exact date/time (UTC) of submission.
[ ] Consent String: Store the exact text of the disclosure the user saw at the time of clicking "Submit."
[ ] IP & User Agent: Record the user's IP address and browser type to verify their location at the time of consent.
[ ] Version Control: Log which version of the Privacy Policy was active when they signed.
The "Record Retention" Policy (TCPA Proof)
In 2026, the biggest risk isn't just a lack of consent; it’s being unable to prove it three years later. You need a 5-year data retention rule for:
Lead Visuals: A "screenshot" or "session replay" (using tools like TrustedForm or Jornaya) that shows the user actually saw the disclosure and clicked the button.
Phone Logs: A log showing the IVR was played to the user at the start of the call.
Note: If you can't produce a "Certificate of Consent" (like a TrustedForm Cert), a lawyer could sue you claiming they never saw the checkbox.






Global Footer Architecture
Privacy Policy
Terms & Conditions
Your Privacy Choices: Do Not Sell or Share / Limit My Sensitive Info (Link to your Opt-Out form)
WA Health Policy
Our Partners & Sponsors

Ensuring Pages are "Indexable"
To prove "public availability" to regulators and Google, you must ensure these pages aren't accidentally hidden from search engines.

Operationalizing the Suppression List
When a user submits the "Your Privacy Choices" form, the "Blacklist" action must be immediate to avoid a TCPA violation (calling someone after they opted out).
The Workflow:
Instant Flag: The form submission should trigger a "Privacy Opt-Out" flag in your CRM.
API Webhook: Your website should send a webhook to your dialer (e.g., RingCentral, Vicidial, etc.) to move that phone number to a "Global DNC" (Do Not Call) list.
Lead Export Block: Before any lead is exported to a law firm, your script must check the email/phone against the Suppression List. If a match exists, the export must be aborted.
Log Entry: Keep a "Privacy Request Log" showing the Timestamp and IP Address of the opt-out. This is your "Receipt" if a partner accidentally calls them and you need to prove it wasn't your fault.

The Form Consents 
Final Summary of State Form Logic:
GA, SC, NC, MO, PA, AZ: Only need the Main Consent checkbox.
CA, TX, CO: Need the Main Consent + Sensitive Data Disclosure text. It must be un-checked by default.
WA: Needs the Main Consent + the Washington Health Data Consent checkbox (unchecked).

The "Call-to-Action" (Lead Form) 
On your actual lead form (where they enter their accident info), ensure the text under the "Submit" button looks like this:

Group A: GA, SC, NC, MO, PA, AZ
Required UI: One (1) Mandatory Checkbox.
"By clicking [Submit], I agree to the [Terms of Service] and [Privacy Policy]. I provide my express written consent for Auto File Claim and its [Marketing Partners] to contact me via live calls, automated dialing systems, and text messages at the number provided. I understand that my consent is not a condition of purchase and that calling or submitting this form does not create an attorney-client relationship."’

Group B: CA, TX, CO
Required UI: Two (2) Checkboxes.
Checkbox 1: Mandatory (Same as Group A).
Checkbox 2: Unchecked by default (Optional, but required to process lead).
Secondary Checkbox Text:
Sensitive Data Consent: I expressly consent to the collection and sharing of my sensitive personal information, including details of my injuries and medical status, with Auto File Claim’s marketing partners as described in the [Privacy Policy]. I understand I can withdraw this consent at any time.

Group C: WA
Required UI: Two (2) Checkboxes.
Checkbox 1: Mandatory (Same as Group A).
Checkbox 2: Unchecked by default (Mandatory for WA residents under MHMDA).
Secondary Checkbox Text:
Washington Health Data Consent: I provide my authorization for the collection and sharing of my consumer health data as defined by the [WA Health Policy]. I acknowledge that my health data will be shared with marketing partners to facilitate my request for legal assistance.












 The "Do Not Sell" (/opt-out) Backend
When the form at /opt-out is submitted, the "Instant Blacklist" should trigger two things:
DNC Tag: Apply a DO_NOT_CONTACT tag to the record in your CRM.
Scrubbing: If you have any "Scheduled" SMS or follow-up emails, the system must immediately cancel them for that specific Lead ID.


Automated Greeting (IVR) should say:
"Thank you for calling Auto File Claim. This call is recorded. By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which can be found at AutoFileClaim.com. To speak with a representative, press 1..."

 The "Audit Trail" (The Receipt)
If you ever get a "Demand Letter" from a lawyer, you need to produce a Certificate of Consent. Tell your developer to save these 5 data points with every lead:
Timestamp: 2026-01-26 19:15:00 UTC
IP Address: 123.45.67.89
Visual Proof: A "TrustedForm" or "Jornaya" token (these are industry-standard third-party scripts that record a video of the user clicking the box).
Checkbox State: TCPA_Box: Checked, Health_Data_Box: Checked.
User Agent: Chrome / iPhone / iOS 17.
